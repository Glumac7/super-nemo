# SUPER-NEMO

SUPER-NEMO is a coding workflow for [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (`omp`). It picks a review process based on the risk of your request: small changes stay small; higher-risk changes get more checks and independent reviewers. It runs inside OMP, not as a separate chat app.

We use OMP because SuperNemo isn't just “an AI that writes code.” It's an orchestration system of implementers, advisors and independent reviewers, and OMP gives us unusually good primitives for building that

## Install

You need `omp` 18.3.0+ (signed in with `omp login` for the model providers you use), git, and Node.js 20+.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glumac7/super-nemo/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads SUPER-NEMO to `~/.super-nemo/repo`, suggests remote models for coding, advising, and review (not OMP's built-in Ollama, LM Studio, or llama.cpp providers by default), then asks before changing your OMP setup. It keeps model roles and the general approval mode you already selected; explicit local model flags still work. **A fresh setup defaults to YOLO:** OMP runs commands without asking, including commands that change files. Choose `--approval write` or `--approval always-ask` to retain command prompts. Regardless of that choice, SUPER-NEMO sets `tools.approval.eval` to `allow` on install or reuse, including when an earlier installation set it to `prompt`: eval runs without its own confirmation. Do not rely on review or deny rules as a permission boundary. The optional live test makes additional model calls; you can skip it.

## Use it

From the repository you want to work on, ask OMP for a code change as usual:

```sh
cd path/to/your-project
omp "Fix the login form error and check the changed behavior"
```

SUPER-NEMO activates automatically for requests to change a repository. It does not run for questions or code-reading requests. It selects:

| Mode | When | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LIGHT | Small, low-risk changes | Implement, check, quality review |
| NORMAL | Most code changes | Implementer with advisor; checks and independent reviews |
| CRITICAL | Security, secrets, data, deploy, or other high-risk changes | Stronger advisor, security review, and human-review handoff |

You can choose a mode explicitly: `omp "super-nemo light: Fix the typo in the footer"` (or `normal` / `critical`). To let it choose, just describe the task; `super-nemo:` also uses automatic selection. Work happens on a non-protected branch. SUPER-NEMO does not push, deploy, or merge unless you explicitly ask.

### Give it your own name

The first install question asks what to call it: type `jake` and it becomes SUPER-JAKE, answering to `super-jake:`, `super-jake light:` and so on (`super-nemo` prefixes keep working). Press Enter to keep SUPER-NEMO. Without questions, pass `--name jake`; `sn install --name nemo` switches back. Updates keep the name you chose.

## Manage the install

```sh
sn status       # Show installation, model choices, and changed settings
sn verify       # Check the installation
sn update       # Fetch updates and reapply your choices
sn uninstall    # Remove SUPER-NEMO; restore settings where safe
```

Install creates an `~/.local/bin/sn` link to the checkout without changing shell startup files or overwriting an existing command. If `~/.local/bin` is not already on `PATH`, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration, or keep using `~/.super-nemo/repo/sn` directly. Uninstall removes only the launcher it created; it leaves `~/.local/bin` in place even if install created that directory. If an install is interrupted after creating the command but before recording its identity, recovery leaves the command and pending state untouched rather than risk deleting an unowned replacement; inspect `~/.local/bin/sn`, move it away if appropriate, then retry.

Launcher cleanup is not a security boundary against another process running as your user: a hostile same-user process can replace its private temporary link between verification and deletion during uninstall. Do not run uninstall alongside untrusted same-user processes.

For an installer-managed official GitHub checkout on `main`, interactive OMP sessions make a best-effort background check at most once every 24 hours and may show a notice when a newer commit is available. There are no checks in headless sessions, forks, manually cloned checkouts, or other branches. The notice uses the Git executable recorded at installation; if Git moves, rerun `~/.super-nemo/repo/sn install` from a clean checkout. The notice never installs anything: preview available commits anytime with `~/.super-nemo/repo/sn update --dry-run`, then install manually with `~/.super-nemo/repo/sn update`. Updates require a clean checkout with an upstream branch.

Running the one-line installer again updates its managed checkout. `~/.super-nemo/repo/sn uninstall` asks before removing anything and keeps settings you changed yourself. Use `~/.super-nemo/repo/sn --help` for flags, including `--dry-run` to preview actions and `--profile` for a non-default OMP profile. If you cloned the repository yourself, run `./sn install` and `./sn update --dry-run` / `./sn update` from that checkout instead; these checkouts do not receive automatic notices.

**Costs and safety:** Reviews and the optional live test make model calls, which can incur API charges. The fresh-install YOLO default removes OMP command approval prompts; eval auto-approval also applies with `--approval write` or `--approval always-ask`. Eval can execute local code with access to your files and processes without asking first. Command deny rules are *not a sandbox*, and a project-level OMP config can replace them. Review commands and permissions before using this on a sensitive project. See the [workflow](skills/super-nemo/SKILL.md) for the full mode rules.
